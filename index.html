            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <p>Cute, small and yellow pomeranian</p>
            <p>Rocket (also named Huihui) is a 6-month Pomeranian puppy with big eyes and a small, black cute nose. Rocket is named Rocket because he runs so fast and energetically all day without even having some rest. Rocket loves to carry his little toy around the house and jump towards my bed.</p>
            
            <p>Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He may be a little shy at first, but he'll 'say hi' to you after a few seconds. He is also friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large size dogs are hard for him to smell, lol. If you meet Rocket, don't hesitate to say hi to him!! He will be super happy the whole day.</p>

            Hua Hua is a three-year-old kitten with gray and black hair. She is a very fond cat, often coming to my desk to play with me when I do my homework. She also likes to rub my side when I watch TV or play mobile phone. At the same time, she is also very warm and gets along well with guests who come to our home to play.</p>

            <p>Unlike other cats who are very afraid of getting out of the house, Hua Hua is very interested in exploring the outside world. Every time when my parents are preparing for a walk at the door, she will come and continue spinning, expressing her wish to go out with my parents.</p>
